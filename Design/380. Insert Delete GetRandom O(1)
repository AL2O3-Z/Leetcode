 Usually the first thing that comes to find when we hear "lookup" , "insert" in constant time is "hashmaps".
That's the reason we use an unordered_map here which stores the element as " key " and its position in vector as the "value ".. 
The average time complexity of search , insert and remove elements from a hashmap is O(1).

However , here we need to support "Random()" access in O(1) as well. so we are using a vector here to achieve that.

Now the code is fairly simple to understand if you read it, but there is a trick to remove the element in O(1) time from a vector.

Here is the trick to remove in constant time.
Assume that the order of elements does not matter.
This is what you need to pay attention to.

Suppose you have a vector (not indices, but actual values in those positions)

0 1 2 3 4 5 6
and you want to remove the value 3. You can turn this into

0 1 2 6 4 5
in O(1) without any issues. (Again assuming that we are not concerned about maintaining any ordering, we are just looking to delete the value 3 in constant time)

Here is the pseudo-code

1. If the element you are trying to remove is the last element in the vector, remove it, done, ELSE,
2. Read the last element of the vector and write it over the element-to-be-removed. (swap is O(1))
3. Now remove the last element of the vector. (C++ pop_back() in a vector is O(1))
That is exactly the trick we are using here, only that we need to update our hashmap as well.
